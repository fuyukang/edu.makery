A simple Event Bus using Dart [Streams](http://api.dartlang.org/docs/releases/latest/dart_async/Stream.html) 
for decoupling applications.

## Event Bus Pattern ##
An Event Bus follows the publish/subscribe pattern. It allows listeners to 
subscribe for events and publishers to fire events. This enables objects to
interact without requiring to explicitly define listeners and keeping track of
them.

### Event Bus and MVC ###
The Event Bus pattern is especially helpful for decoupling [MVC](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_Controller) 
(or [MVP](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_Presenter)) applications.

**One group of MVC** is not a problem.

But as soon as there are **multiple groups of MVCs**, those groups will have to talk
to each other. This creates a tight coupling between the controllers.

By communication through an **Event Bus**, the coupling is reduced.

## Usage ##

### 1. Add Dependency ###
Add the folowing to your **pubspec.yaml** and run **pub install**
```yaml
	dependencies:
	  event_bus: any
```

### 2. Define Events ###
```dart
import 'package:event_bus/event_bus.dart';

final EventType<User> userLoggedInEvent = new EventType<User>();
final EventType<Order> newOrderEvent = new EventType<Order>();
```

Note: The generic type of the event (`User` and `Order` in this case) is the 
type of data that will be provided when the event is fired.

### 3. Create Event Bus ###
Create an instance of `EventBus` and make it available to other classes.

Usually there is just one Event Bus per application, but more than one may be 
set up to group a specific set of events.

```dart
EventBus eventBus = new EventBus();
```

This will instantiate the default implementation of `EventBus` which is
`SimpleEventBus`. You may provide your own `EventBus` by either extending 
`SimpleEventBus` or implementing `EventBus`.

### 4. Register Listeners ###
Register listeners that will be called whenever the event is fired.
```dart
eventBus.on(userLoggedInEvent).listen((User user) {
  print(user.name);	
});
```

`EventBus` uses Dart [Streams](http://api.dartlang.org/docs/releases/latest/dart_async/Stream.html)
as its underlying mechanism to keep track of listeners. You may use all 
functionality available by the [Stream](http://api.dartlang.org/docs/releases/latest/dart_async/Stream.html)
API. One example is the use of [StreamSubscriptions](http://api.dartlang.org/docs/releases/latest/dart_async/StreamSubscription.html)
to later unsubscribe from the events.

```dart
StreamSubscription<User> subscription = eventBus.on(userLoggedInEvent).listen((User user) {
  print(user.name);	
});

subscription.cancel();
```

### 5. Fire Events ###
Finally, we need to fire an event.

```dart
eventBus.fire(userLoggedInEvent, new User('Mickey'));
```
