Eskil, one of my students, provided me with information about how to deploy the JavaFX AddressApp on Mac OS.

I've updated the [AddressApp Tutorial Part VII](/blog/2012/12/18/javafx-tutorial-addressapp-7/) with instructions about JavaFX deployment for Mac.

To see how the end result will look like you can download it as a Mac OS dmg drag-and-drop installer: [AddressApp.dmg](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cfpr4bh25u8qsmz/AddressApp.dmg)

Thank you Eskil for providing this!
