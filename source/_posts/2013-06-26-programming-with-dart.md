The last few months I have been programming with Google's new [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org/) language. I'm very excited about how great it is to work with Dart! Currently, I'm using Dart for the web client of a project called [doxblox](http://doxblox.ch) (site is only in German at the moment).

After a while I found some things that I was missing and started to write a few Dart libraries:

* The first was a [Dart EventBus](/projects/dart-event-bus/) for decoupling applications.
* The second was [HTML5 Drag and Drop](/projects/dart-html5-drag-and-drop/) support.

HTML5 Drag and Drop was quite a task to get working across different browsers! Take a look and let me know what you think or if you have any issues with it.
